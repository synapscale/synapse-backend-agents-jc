# ACTIVE CONTEXT - SYNAPSE BACKEND AGENTS

## üéØ CURRENT OPERATIONAL FOCUS
**Mode:** PLAN (Strategic Implementation Planning)  
**Session:** Level 4 Strategic Planning Phase  
**Priority:** Memory Bank Integration & Enterprise Optimization  
**Context Window:** Multi-LLM Backend Platform Strategic Development

## üìç IMMEDIATE SCOPE

### Primary Planning Areas
1. **Memory Bank Integration Architecture** - Core system integration patterns
2. **Performance & Scalability Strategy** - Enterprise-grade optimization approach  
3. **Advanced Analytics Platform** - Real-time monitoring and insights
4. **Enterprise Security & Multi-tenancy** - Advanced security architecture

### Strategic Components Under Planning

- Multi-provider LLM orchestration system
- Real-time WebSocket execution management
- 46-table PostgreSQL database optimization
- Enterprise authentication & authorization
- Advanced analytics and monitoring systems

## üîÑ CURRENT WORK SESSION

### PLAN Mode Objectives
- [x] Comprehensive codebase structure analysis
- [x] Requirements documentation completed
- [x] Affected subsystems identification  
- [x] Dependencies & integration points mapping
- [x] Phased implementation strategy created
- [x] Creative phase components flagged

### Strategic Planning Focus
- **Memory Bank Integration** - Core architecture and persistence strategies
- **LLM Orchestration** - Multi-provider load balancing and failover
- **Real-time Analytics** - Dashboard and monitoring system design
- **Multi-tenant Security** - Enterprise isolation and compliance
- **Performance Optimization** - Database and caching enhancements

## üìä PLANNING STATUS

### Architecture Analysis Complete
‚úÖ **Codebase Structure** - Comprehensive analysis performed  
‚úÖ **Service Layer Mapping** - 8 major services identified  
‚úÖ **Data Model Review** - 25+ models across domains analyzed  
‚úÖ **Integration Points** - Critical dependencies documented  
‚úÖ **Performance Baseline** - Current system capabilities assessed  

### Implementation Strategy
- **Phase 1:** Memory Bank Integration Foundation (2-3 weeks)
- **Phase 2:** Performance & Scalability Optimization (2-3 weeks)
- **Phase 3:** Advanced Analytics & Monitoring (1-2 weeks)
- **Phase 4:** Enterprise Features & Security (2-3 weeks)

## üéØ STRATEGIC DECISIONS

### Complexity Level Confirmed: 4 (Strategic/Enterprise)
**Justification:**
- Complex multi-service architecture with deep integrations
- Enterprise-scale multi-tenant requirements
- Real-time processing with WebSocket coordination
- Advanced LLM orchestration across multiple providers
- Strategic performance optimization needs

### Creative Phases Required
**Components Flagged for Creative Mode:**
1. **Memory Bank Architecture Design** - Integration patterns exploration
2. **LLM Orchestration Algorithm** - Load balancing strategy design
3. **Real-time Dashboard UI/UX** - Analytics visualization approach
4. **Multi-tenant Isolation Architecture** - Security boundary design
