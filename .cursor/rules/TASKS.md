# PROJECT TASKS - SYNAPSE BACKEND AGENTS

## üéØ CURRENT FOCUS
**CRITICAL FIXES COMPLETED** - Database Schema Issues Resolved
**Project:** Synapse Backend Agents (Multi-LLM Integration Platform)
**Complexity Level:** 4 (Strategic/Enterprise)

## ‚úÖ COMPLETED CRITICAL FIXES (Latest Session)

### Database Schema & Foreign Key Issues - RESOLVED ‚úÖ
- [x] **CRITICAL** - Fixed Agent model foreign key constraints (synapscale_db.users.id, synapscale_db.workspaces.id)
- [x] **CRITICAL** - Added missing schema configuration (__table_args__) to core models:
  - [x] Agent model - schema and foreign keys fixed
  - [x] Workspace model - schema configuration added
  - [x] Workflow model - schema and foreign keys fixed
  - [x] WorkflowNode model - schema and foreign keys fixed
  - [x] WorkflowConnection model - schema and foreign keys fixed
  - [x] Node model - schema and foreign keys fixed
  - [x] NodeTemplate model - schema configuration added
  - [x] NodeRating model - schema and foreign keys fixed
- [x] **CRITICAL** - Fixed async/sync database access patterns in background services:
  - [x] Alert engine background tasks
  - [x] Execution service queue processing
  - [x] Marketplace service compatibility functions
- [x] **CRITICAL** - Application now starts successfully without SQLAlchemy mapper errors
- [x] **CRITICAL** - Health endpoint working (database: "connected")
- [x] **CRITICAL** - API documentation (/docs) accessible
- [x] **CRITICAL** - Core database tables verified in correct schema (synapscale_db)

### API Infrastructure - RESTORED ‚úÖ
- [x] Service starts without foreign key constraint failures
- [x] Database initialization working correctly
- [x] Health checks passing
- [x] Background services running without async/sync errors

## ‚ö†Ô∏è REMAINING SCHEMA ISSUES (Secondary Priority)
**Note:** These don't prevent the application from running but should be fixed for completeness:

### Models Still Missing Schema Configuration:
- [ ] **T0.1** - Fix remaining foreign key references in workspace.py (plans.id, workspace_projects.id, etc.)
- [ ] **T0.2** - Add schema configuration to template.py models
- [ ] **T0.3** - Add schema configuration to analytics.py models  
- [ ] **T0.4** - Add schema configuration to marketplace.py models
- [ ] **T0.5** - Add schema configuration to workflow_execution.py models
- [ ] **T0.6** - Add schema configuration to subscription.py models

## üìã STRATEGIC IMPLEMENTATION PLAN

### Phase 1: Memory Bank Integration Foundation (2-3 weeks)
- [ ] **T1.1** - Integrate memory bank with LLM unified service
- [ ] **T1.2** - Create memory bank API endpoints and routing  
- [ ] **T1.3** - Implement context persistence in workflow execution
- [ ] **T1.4** - Design memory bank database schema and migrations

### Phase 2: Performance & Scalability Optimization (2-3 weeks)
- [ ] **T2.1** - Optimize database queries across 46-table schema
- [ ] **T2.2** - Enhance caching strategy with Redis integration
- [ ] **T2.3** - Scale WebSocket connection management
- [ ] **T2.4** - Implement advanced LLM provider orchestration

### Phase 3: Advanced Analytics & Monitoring (1-2 weeks)
- [ ] **T3.1** - Expand analytics service capabilities
- [ ] **T3.2** - Create real-time monitoring dashboard
- [ ] **T3.3** - Implement memory bank usage analytics
- [ ] **T3.4** - Add system health monitoring features

### Phase 4: Enterprise Features & Security (2-3 weeks)
- [ ] **T4.1** - Enhance multi-tenant workspace isolation
- [ ] **T4.2** - Implement enterprise security features
- [ ] **T4.3** - Add audit logging and compliance features
- [ ] **T4.4** - Optimize production deployment configuration

## üé® CREATIVE PHASE COMPONENTS
### Components Requiring Design Exploration:
- **Memory Bank Architecture** - Integration patterns and persistence strategies
- **LLM Orchestration Algorithm** - Load balancing and failover mechanisms  
- **Real-time Dashboard UI/UX** - Analytics visualization and user experience
- **Multi-tenant Isolation Architecture** - Security boundaries and scalability

## üîÑ STATUS
- **Critical Fixes:** ‚úÖ COMPLETED - Application running successfully
- **Database Schema:** ‚úÖ Core models fixed, secondary issues remain
- **API Infrastructure:** ‚úÖ Working - Health checks passing
- **Memory Bank:** Planning Complete - Implementation Ready
- **Active Context:** Ready for Strategic Implementation
- **Current Mode:** IMPLEMENT (Critical fixes completed)
- **Next Action:** Continue with Memory Bank Integration (Phase 1) or fix remaining schema issues

## üìä ARCHITECTURE ANALYSIS
### Current System Structure:
- **Main Application**: 1000+ lines with comprehensive middleware stack ‚úÖ WORKING
- **API Layer**: Versioned v1 structure with endpoint organization ‚úÖ WORKING
- **Service Layer**: 8 major services managing business logic ‚úÖ WORKING
- **Data Models**: 25+ models across workspace, user, workflow domains ‚úÖ CORE FIXED
- **LLM Integration**: Multi-provider unified service architecture ‚úÖ WORKING
- **WebSocket System**: Real-time communication for execution management ‚úÖ WORKING
- **Database**: PostgreSQL with synapscale_db schema ‚úÖ CONNECTED

### Critical Integration Points:
- Memory Bank ‚Üî LLM Services (context persistence) - **Ready for implementation**
- WebSocket ‚Üî Execution Engine (real-time updates) - **Working**
- Analytics ‚Üî All Services (monitoring integration) - **Working**
- Authentication ‚Üî All Endpoints (security enforcement) - **Working**

## üìù IMPLEMENTATION NOTES
