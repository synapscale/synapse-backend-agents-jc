# PROJECT TASKS - SYNAPSE BACKEND AGENTS

## üéØ CURRENT FOCUS
**PLAN MODE ACTIVATED** - Strategic Implementation Planning
**Project:** Synapse Backend Agents (Multi-LLM Integration Platform)
**Complexity Level:** 4 (Strategic/Enterprise)

## üìã STRATEGIC IMPLEMENTATION PLAN

### Phase 1: Memory Bank Integration Foundation (2-3 weeks)
- [ ] **T1.1** - Integrate memory bank with LLM unified service
- [ ] **T1.2** - Create memory bank API endpoints and routing  
- [ ] **T1.3** - Implement context persistence in workflow execution
- [ ] **T1.4** - Design memory bank database schema and migrations

### Phase 2: Performance & Scalability Optimization (2-3 weeks)
- [ ] **T2.1** - Optimize database queries across 46-table schema
- [ ] **T2.2** - Enhance caching strategy with Redis integration
- [ ] **T2.3** - Scale WebSocket connection management
- [ ] **T2.4** - Implement advanced LLM provider orchestration

### Phase 3: Advanced Analytics & Monitoring (1-2 weeks)
- [ ] **T3.1** - Expand analytics service capabilities
- [ ] **T3.2** - Create real-time monitoring dashboard
- [ ] **T3.3** - Implement memory bank usage analytics
- [ ] **T3.4** - Add system health monitoring features

### Phase 4: Enterprise Features & Security (2-3 weeks)
- [ ] **T4.1** - Enhance multi-tenant workspace isolation
- [ ] **T4.2** - Implement enterprise security features
- [ ] **T4.3** - Add audit logging and compliance features
- [ ] **T4.4** - Optimize production deployment configuration

## üé® CREATIVE PHASE COMPONENTS
### Components Requiring Design Exploration:
- **Memory Bank Architecture** - Integration patterns and persistence strategies
- **LLM Orchestration Algorithm** - Load balancing and failover mechanisms  
- **Real-time Dashboard UI/UX** - Analytics visualization and user experience
- **Multi-tenant Isolation Architecture** - Security boundaries and scalability

## üîÑ STATUS
- **Memory Bank:** Planning Complete - Implementation Ready
- **Active Context:** Strategic Implementation Planning
- **Current Mode:** PLAN (Level 4 Strategic Planning)
- **Next Action:** Begin Creative Phase for flagged components

## üìä ARCHITECTURE ANALYSIS
### Current System Structure:
- **Main Application**: 1000+ lines with comprehensive middleware stack
- **API Layer**: Versioned v1 structure with endpoint organization
- **Service Layer**: 8 major services managing business logic
- **Data Models**: 25+ models across workspace, user, workflow domains
- **LLM Integration**: Multi-provider unified service architecture
- **WebSocket System**: Real-time communication for execution management

### Critical Integration Points:
- Memory Bank ‚Üî LLM Services (context persistence)
- WebSocket ‚Üî Execution Engine (real-time updates)
- Analytics ‚Üî All Services (monitoring integration)
- Authentication ‚Üî All Endpoints (security enforcement)

## üìù IMPLEMENTATION NOTES
- Phased approach ensures minimal disruption to existing functionality
- Creative phases required for complex architectural decisions
- Performance optimization critical for enterprise scalability
- Security and compliance features essential for enterprise adoption
