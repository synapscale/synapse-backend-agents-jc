			"taskId": 1,
			"taskTitle": "Create UnifiedLLMService",
			"complexityScore": 7,
			"recommendedSubtasks": 4,
			"expansionPrompt": "Break down the implementation of UnifiedLLMService into subtasks for database connection, method implementation, error handling, and integration with existing systems.",
			"reasoning": "This task involves creating a central component for accessing LLM data, requiring database interactions, implementation of multiple methods, and integration with existing systems. The complexity is high due to the need for careful design and potential impact on other parts of the system."
		},
		{
			"taskId": 2,
			"taskTitle": "Implement Redis Cache for LLM Data",
			"complexityScore": 8,
			"recommendedSubtasks": 5,
			"expansionPrompt": "Divide the Redis cache implementation into subtasks for cache setup, intelligent invalidation, memory-based fallback, integration with UnifiedLLMService, and performance testing.",
			"reasoning": "Implementing a caching layer with Redis involves complex logic for cache management, fallback mechanisms, and integration with existing services. The high complexity score reflects the need for careful implementation to ensure performance improvements without introducing new issues."

		{
			"taskId": 3,
			"taskTitle": "Migrate /llm/models Endpoint",
			"complexityScore": 6,
			"recommendedSubtasks": 3,
			"expansionPrompt": "Break down the migration of the /llm/models endpoint into subtasks for updating the route implementation, ensuring backward compatibility, and implementing fallback mechanisms.",
			"reasoning": "This task requires modifying an existing endpoint to use the new UnifiedLLMService while maintaining backward compatibility. The complexity is moderate due to the need to handle potential failures and ensure consistent behavior."
		},
		{
			"taskId": 4,
			"taskTitle": "Migrate /llm/providers Endpoint",
			"complexityScore": 5,
			"recommendedSubtasks": 3,
			"expansionPrompt": "Divide the migration of the /llm/providers endpoint into subtasks for updating the route implementation, ensuring backward compatibility, and implementing fallback mechanisms.",
			"reasoning": "Similar to the /llm/models endpoint migration, this task involves updating an existing endpoint. The complexity is slightly lower as it deals with a simpler data structure (providers list)."
		},
		{
			"taskId": 5,
			"taskTitle": "Implement /llm/catalog Endpoints",
			"complexityScore": 7,
			"recommendedSubtasks": 4,
			"expansionPrompt": "Break down the implementation of /llm/catalog endpoints into subtasks for creating the main catalog endpoint, implementing the detailed view endpoint, designing response schemas, and integrating with UnifiedLLMService.",
			"reasoning": "Creating new endpoints with enhanced functionality requires careful design of the API contract, integration with the new service, and comprehensive error handling. The complexity is high due to the need to provide detailed information and filtering capabilities."
		},
		{
			"taskId": 6,
			"taskTitle": "Create Transition Aliases for /llms/* Endpoints",
			"complexityScore": 5,
			"recommendedSubtasks": 3,
			"expansionPrompt": "Divide the creation of transition aliases into subtasks for implementing redirect logic, adding deprecation warnings, and logging usage of old endpoints.",
			"reasoning": "Setting up alias routes for a smooth transition is moderately complex, involving redirect logic and the addition of deprecation warnings. The task is important for maintaining backward compatibility but doesn't involve complex business logic."
		},
		{
			"taskId": 7,
			"taskTitle": "Update Generate and Chat Endpoints",
			"complexityScore": 8,
			"recommendedSubtasks": 5,
			"expansionPrompt": "Break down the update of generate and chat endpoints into subtasks for integrating UnifiedLLMService validation, maintaining existing functionality, updating error handling, ensuring performance, and comprehensive testing.",
			"reasoning": "Modifying core functionality endpoints while maintaining all existing features and integrating new validation logic is highly complex. It requires careful consideration of all edge cases and potential impacts on the system."
		},
		{
			"taskId": 8,
			"taskTitle": "Implement Monitoring and Observability",
			"complexityScore": 7,
			"recommendedSubtasks": 4,
			"expansionPrompt": "Divide the implementation of monitoring and observability into subtasks for setting up structured logging, implementing metrics collection, creating health checks, and configuring alerts.",
			"reasoning": "Setting up comprehensive monitoring involves working with multiple systems (logging, metrics, health checks) and requires careful consideration of what to monitor and how to alert. The complexity is high due to the need for thorough coverage without impacting system performance."
		},
		{
			"taskId": 9,
			"taskTitle": "Create Database Migration Plan",
			"complexityScore": 6,
			"recommendedSubtasks": 4,
			"expansionPrompt": "Break down the database migration plan into subtasks for analyzing existing data, creating migration scripts, implementing validation checks, and designing a rollback strategy.",
			"reasoning": "Creating a migration plan involves careful analysis of existing data structures and potential inconsistencies. The complexity is moderate due to the need for thorough testing and validation to ensure data integrity."
		},
		{
			"taskId": 10,
			"taskTitle": "Create Documentation and Deprecation Plan",
			"complexityScore": 5,
			"recommendedSubtasks": 3,
			"expansionPrompt": "Divide the documentation and deprecation plan creation into subtasks for updating API documentation, creating a migration guide for clients, and developing a timeline for deprecation.",
			"reasoning": "While crucial for the project's success, this task is primarily focused on communication and planning rather than complex technical implementation. The moderate complexity reflects the need for comprehensive coverage and clear communication."
