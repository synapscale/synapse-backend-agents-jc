# Task ID: 2
# Title: Configure Premium Plans Features
# Status: pending
# Dependencies: 1
# Priority: high
# Description: Fix the critical issue with premium plans (BASIC, PRO, ENTERPRISE) that currently have NULL features and restrictions.
# Details:
1. Create a migration script to properly configure features for each premium plan
2. Use SQLAlchemy 2.0 with Alembic for migrations
3. Configure specific features per plan according to PRD requirements:
   - BASIC: API access, webhooks, analytics (5 features)
   - PRO: + Custom branding, team collaboration (8 features)
   - ENTERPRISE: + SSO, white label, priority support (12 features)
4. SQL implementation:
```sql
-- Clear existing incorrect configurations
DELETE FROM plan_features WHERE plan_id IN 
  (SELECT id FROM plans WHERE name IN ('BASIC', 'PRO', 'ENTERPRISE'));

-- Insert correct BASIC plan features
INSERT INTO plan_features (plan_id, feature_id)
SELECT p.id, f.id FROM plans p, features f
WHERE p.name = 'BASIC' AND f.name IN 
  ('api_access', 'webhooks', 'basic_analytics', 'data_export', 'email_support');

-- Insert correct PRO plan features (includes BASIC + additional)
INSERT INTO plan_features (plan_id, feature_id)
SELECT p.id, f.id FROM plans p, features f
WHERE p.name = 'PRO' AND f.name IN 
  ('api_access', 'webhooks', 'advanced_analytics', 'data_export', 'email_support',
   'custom_branding', 'team_collaboration', 'priority_email_support');

-- Insert correct ENTERPRISE plan features (includes PRO + additional)
INSERT INTO plan_features (plan_id, feature_id)
SELECT p.id, f.id FROM plans p, features f
WHERE p.name = 'ENTERPRISE' AND f.name IN 
  ('api_access', 'webhooks', 'advanced_analytics', 'data_export', 'email_support',
   'custom_branding', 'team_collaboration', 'priority_email_support',
   'sso_integration', 'white_label', 'priority_support', 'dedicated_account_manager');

-- Update plans table to remove NULL values
UPDATE plans
SET restrictions = '{}'
WHERE restrictions IS NULL AND name IN ('BASIC', 'PRO', 'ENTERPRISE');
```
5. Create a validation function to verify plan configuration integrity

# Test Strategy:
1. Unit tests to verify each premium plan has the correct number of features
2. Integration tests to ensure the application correctly identifies premium features
3. Create test cases for each plan to verify feature access boundaries
4. Test upgrade/downgrade scenarios between plans
5. Verify feature gates work correctly in the application
6. Performance test to ensure plan feature verification completes in <100ms
