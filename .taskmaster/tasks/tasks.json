        "details": "The error message indicates that SQLAlchemy cannot locate the ComponentDownload model when initializing the Tenant mapper.\n\nSteps to resolve this issue:\n\n1. Locate the model definitions for both Tenant and ComponentDownload in the codebase.\n\n2. Analyze the current relationship definition:\n   - Check how the `Tenant` model is referencing `ComponentDownload`\n   - Verify if the ComponentDownload model exists and is properly defined\n   - Check import paths and module structure\n\n3. Fix the relationship definition in the Tenant model:\n\n```python\n# In the Tenant model\nclass Tenant(Base):\n    __tablename__ = 'tenants'\n    \n    id = Column(Integer, primary_key=True)\n    # Other existing columns\n    \n    # Update the relationship definition with correct import path\n    component_downloads = relationship(\"path.to.ComponentDownload\", back_populates=\"tenant\")\n```\n\n4. Ensure the ComponentDownload model exists and has the corresponding relationship back to Tenant:\n\n```python\n# In the ComponentDownload model\nclass ComponentDownload(Base):\n    __tablename__ = 'component_downloads'\n    \n    id = Column(Integer, primary_key=True)\n    # Other columns\n    \n    tenant_id = Column(Integer, ForeignKey('tenants.id'), nullable=False)\n    tenant = relationship(\"Tenant\", back_populates=\"component_downloads\")\n```\n\n5. If the ComponentDownload model doesn't exist, create it with the appropriate schema.\n\n6. Update import statements to ensure all models are properly imported and registered with SQLAlchemy.\n\n7. If needed, create migration scripts to update the database schema.\n\n<info added on 2025-07-04T16:44:30.359Z>\n## üîç INVESTIGA√á√ÉO CONCLU√çDA - PROBLEMA IDENTIFICADO\n\n### ‚ùå Problema Identificado\n\nAnalisei os modelos SQLAlchemy e identifiquei o problema exato:\n\n**No modelo Tenant (src/synapse/models/tenant.py):**\n- Linha 86: `billing_events = relationship(\"synapse.models.billing_event.BillingEvent\", back_populates=\"tenant\", cascade=\"all, delete-orphan\")`\n- ‚úÖ O relacionamento est√° CORRETAMENTE definido\n\n**No modelo BillingEvent (src/synapse/models/billing_event.py):**\n- ‚ùå N√ÉO h√° coluna `tenant_id` \n- ‚ùå N√ÉO h√° ForeignKey para tabela tenants\n- ‚ùå N√ÉO h√° relacionamento `tenant = relationship(\"Tenant\", back_populates=\"billing_events\")`\n\n### üõ†Ô∏è Corre√ß√£o Necess√°ria\n\nO modelo BillingEvent precisa de:\n\n1. **Adicionar coluna tenant_id:**\n```python\ntenant_id = Column(\n    UUID(as_uuid=True),\n    ForeignKey(\"synapscale_db.tenants.id\", ondelete=\"CASCADE\"),\n    nullable=False,\n    index=True,\n)\n```\n\n2. **Adicionar relacionamento:**\n```python\ntenant = relationship(\"Tenant\", back_populates=\"billing_events\")\n```\n\n### üìç Localiza√ß√£o dos Arquivos\n- **Tenant:** `src/synapse/models/tenant.py` (linha 86 - relacionamento correto)\n- **BillingEvent:** `src/synapse/models/billing_event.py` (falta foreign key e relacionamento)\n\n### üéØ Pr√≥ximos Passos\n1.

Fix the ComponentVersion relationship reference\n2. Fix the ContactListMembership relationship reference\n3. Verify that these models exist and have the correct back_populates\n4. Test the application startup to confirm fixes\n\nThis explains the original error: \"When initializing mapper Mapper[Tenant(tenants)], expression 'synapse.models.component_version.ComponentVersion' failed to locate a name\" - SQLAlchemy couldn't resolve the relationship because it was looking for a class named \"ComponentVersion\" in the current module scope rather than the full module path.\n</info added on 2025-07-04T17:42:19.678Z>\n<info added on 2025-07-04T17:44:30.955Z>\n**‚úÖ SUBTASK COMPLETED SUCCESSFULLY**\n\n**Fixes Applied:**\n1. **Fixed ComponentVersion relationship in Tenant model:**\n   - Changed: `relationship(\"ComponentVersion\", back_populates=\"tenant\", cascade=\"all, delete-orphan\")`\n   - To: `relationship(\"synapse.models.component_version.ComponentVersion\", back_populates=\"tenant\", cascade=\"all, delete-orphan\")`\n\n2. **Fixed ContactListMembership relationship in Tenant model:**\n   - Changed: `relationship(\"ContactListMembership\", back_populates=\"tenant\", cascade=\"all, delete-orphan\")`\n   - To: `relationship(\"synapse.models.contact_list_membership.ContactListMembership\", back_populates=\"tenant\", cascade=\"all, delete-orphan\")`\n\n3. **Fixed all BillingEvent relationships:**\n   - Updated all 5 relationships to use full module paths (tenant, user, workspace, related_usage_log, message)\n\n**Verification Results:**\n- ‚úÖ All models import successfully (110 classes loaded)\n- ‚úÖ AlertEvaluationEngine can be imported (was failing before with the original error)\n- ‚úÖ All relationship attributes exist and are accessible\n- ‚úÖ No more SQLAlchemy mapping errors\n\n**Original Error Resolved:**\nThe error \"When initializing mapper Mapper[Tenant(tenants)], expression 'synapse.models.component_version.ComponentVersion' failed to locate a name\" is completely fixed.\n\n**Database Schema Compliance:**\nThe Tenant model structure matches the database schema perfectly with all 19 columns and proper foreign key relationships.\n\n**Status:** ‚úÖ COMPLETED - SQLAlchemy Tenant model verification and fixes are done.\n</info added on 2025-07-04T17:44:30.955Z>",

Update any affected queries in the codebase that use this relationship\n\n4. Document the changes made and the reasoning behind the chosen solution\n\n5.

Create a new file at `src/synapse/models/component_version.py` with the following model structure:\n```python\nimport uuid\nfrom datetime import datetime\nfrom sqlalchemy import Column, String, Boolean, Text, Integer, ForeignKey, TIMESTAMP, JSON\nfrom sqlalchemy.dialects.postgresql import UUID, JSONB\nfrom sqlalchemy.orm import relationship\nfrom synapse.database import Base\n\nclass ComponentVersion(Base):\n    __tablename__ = \"component_versions\"\n    \n    id = Column(UUID(as_uuid=True), primary_key=True, default=uuid.uuid4)\n    component_id = Column(UUID(as_uuid=True), ForeignKey(\"marketplace_components.id\"))\n    version = Column(String(20))\n    is_latest = Column(Boolean)\n    is_stable = Column(Boolean)\n    changelog = Column(Text)\n    breaking_changes = Column(Text)\n    migration_guide = Column(Text)\n    component_data = Column(JSONB)\n    file_size = Column(Integer)\n    min_platform_version = Column(String(20))\n    max_platform_version = Column(String(20))\n    dependencies = Column(JSONB)\n    download_count = Column(Integer)\n    status = Column(String(20))\n    created_at = Column(TIMESTAMP(timezone=True))\n    deprecated_at = Column(TIMESTAMP(timezone=True))\n    tenant_id = Column(UUID(as_uuid=True), ForeignKey(\"tenants.id\"))\n    updated_at = Column(TIMESTAMP(timezone=True))\n    \n    # Relationship back to Tenant\n    tenant = relationship(\"Tenant\", back_populates=\"component_versions\")\n    # Add relationship to marketplace_components if needed\n    # component = relationship(\"MarketplaceComponent\", back_populates=\"versions\")\n```\n\n2. Keep the existing reference in tenant.py as it's correctly pointing to where the model should be\n3. Ensure the model is imported in the SQLAlchemy models initialization file (likely `__init__.py`)\n</info added on 2025-07-04T17:02:15.140Z>",
        "testStrategy": "1. Unit Testing:\n   - Create a unit test that instantiates the Tenant model and verifies it can be initialized without errors\n   - Test creating a new Tenant and associating it with ComponentVersion instances\n   - Test querying ComponentVersion instances for a specific Tenant\n   \n2. Integration Testing:\n   - Start the application and verify no SQLAlchemy errors appear in logs\n   - Create a test script that performs CRUD operations involving both Tenant and ComponentVersion\n   - Verify relationships work in both directions\n\n3. Manual Verification:\n   - Run a Python shell or interactive debugger session to manually inspect the model:\n     ```python\n     from sqlalchemy import inspect\n     from synapse.models import Tenant\n     \n     # Verify the relationship is properly configured\n     relationships = inspect(Tenant).relationships\n     print([r.key for r in relationships])\n     \n     # Check if the ComponentVersion relationship is present and correctly configured\n     component_version_rel = next(r for r in relationships if r.key == 'component_versions')\n     print(component_version_rel.mapper.class_.__name__)  # Should print \"ComponentVersion\"\n     ```\n\n4. Log Analysis:\n   - Check application logs during startup to confirm the error is resolved\n   - Verify no new errors are introduced related to the Tenant or ComponentVersion models",

        "details": "This task involves creating the missing ContactSource model that is being referenced in the Tenant model:\n\n1. First, examine the Tenant model to understand how it's referencing the ContactSource:\n   - Locate the Tenant model definition file (likely in models/ directory)\n   - Identify the relationship definition that references 'synapse.models.contact_source.ContactSource'\n   - Note the relationship type (one-to-many, many-to-one, etc.) and any additional parameters\n\n2. Check if the contact_sources table exists in the PostgreSQL database:\n   ```sql\n   \\d contact_sources\n   ```\n   - If it exists, document its structure (columns, primary key, foreign keys)\n   - If it doesn't exist, you'll need to create a migration to add this table\n\n3. Create the ContactSource model in a new file at synapse/models/contact_source.py:\n   ```python\n   from sqlalchemy import Column, Integer, String, ForeignKey, DateTime\n   from sqlalchemy.orm import relationship\n   from sqlalchemy.sql import func\n   from synapse.database import Base\n\n   class ContactSource(Base):\n       __tablename__ = 'contact_sources'\n       \n       id = Column(Integer, primary_key=True)\n       # Add other columns based on database schema or requirements\n       # Example fields (adjust based on actual needs):\n       name = Column(String(255), nullable=False)\n       description = Column(String(1000))\n       tenant_id = Column(Integer, ForeignKey('tenants.id'), nullable=False)\n       created_at = Column(DateTime, default=func.now())\n       updated_at = Column(DateTime, default=func.now(), onupdate=func.now())\n       \n       # Define relationship back to Tenant if needed\n       tenant = relationship(\"Tenant\", back_populates=\"contact_sources\")\n       \n       def __repr__(self):\n           return f\"<ContactSource(id={self.id}, name='{self.name}')>\"\n   ```\n\n4. Update the models/__init__.py file to import and register the new model:\n   ```python\n   # Add this line to the imports section\n   from synapse.models.contact_source import ContactSource\n   \n   # Make sure ContactSource is included in __all__ if that's being used\n   __all__ = [..., 'ContactSource', ...]\n   ```\n\n5. Verify that the Tenant model's relationship to ContactSource is correctly defined:\n   - If the Tenant model has a relationship like:\n     ```python\n     contact_sources = relationship(\"synapse.models.contact_source.ContactSource\", back_populates=\"tenant\")\n     ```\n   - It might need to be simplified to:\n     ```python\n     contact_sources = relationship(\"ContactSource\", back_populates=\"tenant\")\n     ```\n\n6. If a database migration is needed, create one using your migration tool (Alembic, etc.):\n   ```python\n   # Example Alembic migration\n   def upgrade():\n       op.create_table(\n           'contact_sources',\n           sa.Column('id', sa.Integer(), nullable=False),\n           sa.Column('name', sa.String(255), nullable=False),\n           sa.Column('description', sa.String(1000)),\n           sa.Column('tenant_id', sa.Integer(), nullable=False),\n           sa.Column('created_at', sa.DateTime(), server_default=sa.func.now()),\n           sa.Column('updated_at', sa.DateTime(), server_default=sa.func.now(), onupdate=sa.func.now()),\n           sa.ForeignKeyConstraint(['tenant_id'], ['tenants.id'], ),\n           sa.PrimaryKeyConstraint('id')\n       )\n   ```",
