## Notes for Task Master Integration

This PRD will be processed by Task Master to generate:
1. **Structured Tasks**: Based on the requirements above
2. **Complexity Analysis**: To identify which areas need detailed breakdown
3. **Dependency Management**: To ensure proper implementation order
4. **Progress Tracking**: To monitor completion of each requirement

**Command to use**: `task-master parse-prd scripts/PRD.txt --research --num-tasks=10`
